This R package is for QTL analysis of diploid and autotetraploid diallel populations. Phenotypes are regressed on genotype probabilities, and the regression coefficients are random effects. R package BGLR is used for the regression analysis. The PolyOrigin software is recommended to calculate the genotype probabilities.

A [vignette is available](https://jendelman.github.io/diaQTL/diaQTL.html) to illustrate the workflow using a sample potato dataset. More detailed information is available in the [package reference manual](https://jendelman.github.io/diaQTL/diaQTL.pdf).
