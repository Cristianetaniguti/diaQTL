This R package is for QTL and haplotype analysis of autotetraploid (and diploid) diallel populations. Phenotypes are regressed on genotype probabilities, and the regression coefficients are random effects. R package BGLR is used for the regression analysis. The [PolyOrigin software](https://github.com/chaozhi/PolyOrigin.jl) is recommended to calculate the genotype probabilities for tetraploids.

A [vignette is available](https://jendelman.github.io/diaQTL/diaQTL_vignette.html) to illustrate the workflow using a sample potato dataset, and more detailed information is available in the [reference manual](https://jendelman.github.io/diaQTL/diaQTL_manual.pdf).
